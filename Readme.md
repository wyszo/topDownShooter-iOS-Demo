topDownShooter-iOS-Demo
=======================

License: MIT

Simple Top-Down Shooter Game (Objective-C, Cocos2D, iOS 4.2, no ARC, manual memory management, no Retina support). Simple online highscores using php + mysql. 

Developed quickly in late 2011 and basically not touched since then, don't expect it to be fancy (hope I'll have time to finish this demo some day and turn it into sth cool).

Sprites & gfx partially drawn by me, partially taken from Sinistar:

Music generated using Wolfram Tones. 
Sfx generated using sfxr. 

Hint: running the game using Debug configuration skips all the intro scenes.
